<p class="body">Using this form, you can setup the basic characteristics of your hero. This includes the starting level and funds for a 5th Edition SRD hero, which expedites the creation of higher-level characters. If you want to create a 5th level character with 3,200 GP in savings, simply tell Hero Lab by adjusting the values on this form, and the appropriate starting resources will be automatically assigned to the hero.

<p class="body">On the right of the form is a list of rules the hero is built under. You can choose to enable whole new sourcebooks here, or specific optional rules or output options. See the <a href="#settings">Settings</a> section for more information.

<p class="body">You can select from among several methods for generating ability scores, allowing you to roll dice in real life to generate the scores, or choose from point-based or ability-array systems.

<p class="body">For GMs, if you're creating a non-player character who's neutral or unfriendly to the players, select "Enemy of Party" in the "Alliance" menu. This distinguishes the appearance of the character on the Tactical Console, allowing you to easily differentiate between allies and enemies.

<p class="body">If you want to come back to the configuration form later, just click the "Hero" menu and select "Configure Hero".

<p class="body">Once your new hero is created and configured, you're presented with Hero Lab's main window. The main window is organized with an area across the top that contains basic information about the character, a series of tab panels below, which you can switch between, and summary panels in the remaining space on the right-hand side.

</ul>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>

<p><img border="0" src="static.png"/>

<p class="body">This includes the character's name, race, alignment, hit points, armor class, etc. It also includes an approximation of how much gold your hero possesses (e.g. if you have 102 silver pieces and 1 platinum piece, the value shown will be "~20 GP").

<p class="body">Clicking on a tab name switches the contents shown within the edit panel region. You can also use &lt;Ctrl+Tab&gt; and &lt;Ctrl+Shift+Tab&gt; on the keyboard to move back and forth between tabs. New panels may appear and disappear based on your choices for the hero. For example, selecting an option that gives your hero access to spells could add a "Spells" tab. If there are too many tabs for the width of the screen, the excess will appear in a second row above the first.

<p class="body">To the right of the edit panel, you'll see a number of summary panels that provide details about your character in summary form for quick reference. In general, there will be a summary panel that corresponds to each tab across the top. Summary panels will be described in more detail in the next section.

<p><img border="0" src="summaries.png"/>

<p class="body">At the very bottom is the validation bar, in which anything invalid for the character will be identified. If there are one or more facets of the character that need your attention, an appropriate indicator button <img border="0" src="invalid.png"/>
 appears in both the top right corner of the main window and in the lower left corner on the validation bar to flag this fact.

<p class="body">Clicking on either button provides a detailed report of the issues identified by Hero Lab.

<p><img border="0" src="validation.png"/>

<p class="body">The list on the left shows the different heroes in the portfolio. The current hero is selected, but you can see the validation errors for any other hero by clicking on their name. You can also click on the "Load" icon beside the name to immediately switch to a hero.

<p class="body">Throughout the main window, you'll see a number of areas highlighted in the color red. These are items that are currently invalid and require your attention. There may also be items highlighted in a different color, which indicates something that isn't necessarily "wrong" but that should probably be investigated (e.g. unallocated skill or language selections). Important selectors, such as alignment, race, and background, are typically marked in red until you choose appropriate values for them.

<p class="body">If an error occurs on a particular tab, the title of the tab will be shown in red to draw your attention to where to correct the problem. For example, your hero needs to select its first level, so the "Basics" tab starts out in red. To address a problem on a tab, click on the tab and look for areas on the tab that are shown in red or yellow.

<p class="body">Before starting to define your character, move the mouse over the skill names in the "Skills" summary panel on the right. As you move the mouse over each entry, help text appears with information about the item underneath. By using the mouse-over technique, Hero Lab keeps the screen free from unnecessary clutter while making sure you've got full access to the information whenever you need it.

<p><img border="0" src="mouseinfo.png"/>

<p class="section">Summary Panels

<p class="body">Summary panels provide an excellent solution to a critical problem in character creation. All the various facets of a character are highly inter-connected. Changing an ability score directly influences the skills that are tied to that ability, as well as attack and damage values for weapons. Numerous feats influence skills. Equipment such as armor impacts the bonuses conferred by ability scores, which in turn affect skills. Magic items modify ability scores, which in turn influence other aspects. When creating a character, it's critical to see the cascading effects of these inter-connections. Summary panels eliminate the need to switch between tabs to see the effects, instead putting those connections and dependencies in full and immediate view.

<p class="body">The Hero Lab main window initially starts out with relatively small dimensions so that users with smaller displays can utilize the product. However, Hero Lab takes full advantage of additional screen space. When you first launch Hero Lab, you will see two summary panels visible. If you have a bigger monitor, you can resize or maximize the main window to be a good bit wider. After you gain sufficient extra width, additional summary panels appear that takes advantage of that width. The next panel that appears is the "Armory" panel, which will show all of the weapons and armor selected for your hero. If you keep widening, additional summary panels appear. By leveraging summary panels, Hero Lab lets you take full advantage of the screen space you have available.

<p><img border="0" src="allsummaries.png"/>

<p class="body">You can customize the positioning of the summary panels. Clicking on the little downward arrow button in the upper right corner of a summary panel brings up a menu that allows you to hide the panel or move it around in the sequence shown. For example, click on the button above the "Skills & Feats" summary panel and select the "Move Summary Right" option. The "Armory" summary panel appears in place of the "Skills & Feats" panel, since the "Skills & Feats" panel has been moved one position to the right. This lets you tailor the summary panels to maximize their usefulness for the characters you create.

<p class="section">Race Tab

<p><img border="0" src="race.png"/>

<p class="body">The Race tab allows you to pick your hero's race, plus any starting skill and language choices. Any racial special abilities can also be viewed here. Simply click "Choosse Race" to get started.

<p class="body">Although the Race tab appears first, you don't need to start there - you could begin by choosing your ability scores, or classes, or weapons, or anything else. Just go to whichever tab you want, and get started!

<p class="section">Classes Tab

<p class="body">Next, pick your character class on the "Class" tab.

<p><img border="0" src="noclasses.png"/>

<p class="body">The large "Level Up!" button is telling us that we have to add a level of a character class. Click it to select a class.

<p><img border="0" src="chooseclass.png"/>


<p class="body">Within the form, the list of classes appears on the left, with complete details for the selected class shown on the right. Any class which is not currently selectable is displayed in dark grey. If you click on a greyed out class, you'll see a message in the description region telling you why you can't take that class right now. For example, your alignment may be a problem, or you might be trying to multiclass without meeting the proper requirements. Try clicking on a few classes to see this in action. You can also use the cursor keys, page up, page down, home and end to navigate.

<p class="body">Double-clicking on a class, or selecting a class and clicking  at the bottom, adds a level of that class to your Hero and closes the form. Clicking <img border="0" src="btn_add.png"/>
 or just pressing the <+> key on your keyboard, adds a level of the selected class and keeps the form open. If you want to add multiple levels at the same time - for example, if you're creating a 5th level Barbarian - you can type the number you want in the "Number to Add" box in the lower right before clicking either <img border="0" src="btn_addclose.png"/>
 or <img border="0" src="btn_add.png"/>. By entering values and using the <img border="0" src="btn_add.png"/> button, you can quickly create a high-level or multi-class character. Pressing <img border="0" src="btn_close.png"/> button dismisses the form and returns to the main window.

<p class="body">After you add some class levels, each new level appears on the Classes edit panel. Next to each class level, you'll see an area to specify the hit points for that level. You can use the delete button on the right to delete the level and choose a different class. If you have assigned sufficient class levels, the "Level Up!" indicator is replaced with the next experience point threshold needed for the next level. If you want to go back and add more classes, simply click in the region that shows how many XP are needed to reach the next level. Hero Lab doesn't preclude you from adding more classes than you have XP, but it will detect and warn you when something is wrong. This behavior is true for virtually every aspect of Hero Lab.

<p class="body">A number of things occur automatically when the class is added, including your profiency bonus and total hit points being adjusted. Any special abilities applicable to the new class level are added to the tab for the class and the Special tab, plus the In-Play tab is populated with entries for consumable abilities (e.g. cleric turning has a per-day allotment). All of these effects can also be seen within the various summary panels.

<p class="body">Every 4th level of each class (or thereabouts), you'll be prompted to pick an ability score increase or feat. To do so, simply click on the appropriate button on the tab for the class.

<p class="body">If you create a multi-class character, you may want to control which class is designated at different levels, especially the initial 1st level class (for the purpose of picking the most beneficial initial class). After adding the classes, you can change their order by dragging and dropping, or by right-clicking a class level to move it. Move the class to its desired location in the sequence and Hero Lab will re-calculate everything appropriately. Remember that the class levels shown work upwards, so the class assigned at 1st level will be the one at the bottom of the list.

<p class="section">Abilities Tab

<p class="body">Now that we've chosen our race and class, we can pick our ability scores.

<p><img border="0" src="basics.png"/>

<p class="body">If you picked one of the point-based methods for ability scores on the "Configure Hero" form, you'll see a message telling you if you've spent too many or too few points. Modifying attribute scores is as simple as clicking the up/down arrows on the right of the appropriate ability. If you want to directly enter a value, simply click over the current value and you can edit the current value. As bonuses are conferred, they will appear next to the ability score. In addition, those same bonuses are reflected on the corresponding skills, attack bonuses, saves, etc.

<p class="body">To see this in action, increase your Charisma score by a few points and watch the linked skills (like Intimidation and Persuasion) adjust accordingly within the "Skills" summary panel. Now increase your Strength score and watch your attack bonuses adjust (as well as the Jump and Swim skills). Modify the Dexterity score and the adjustments appear for your ranged attack, Reflex save, and assorted skills.

<p class="body">Other calculated traits, like your saving throws, initiative bonus, and proficiency bonus are also displayed here.

<p class="section">Background Tab

<p><img border="0" src="background.png"/>

<p class="body">The Background tab allows you to pick your hero's background, alignment and worshipped deity. You can also pick ideals, bonds, or other options, or just ask Hero Lab to choose them at random for you.

<p class="section">Class-Specific Tabs

<p class="body">In the interest of only showing you the information you need, when you need it, Hero Lab starts out hiding all the class-specific details for classes such as clerics, wizards, etc. Whenever you add a level in a new class, a corresponding tab automatically appears above the edit panel.

<p class="body">For example, if you add one or more levels of Cleric, the "Cleric" and "Cleric Spells" tabs appear in the list. On these tabs, you'll find all the details specific to the corresponding class. For example, on the "Cleric" tab, you'll find all cleric-specific details, such as skill proficiency and domain selections. If you create a multi-class character, then you'll see multiple class tabs - one for each.

<p><img border="0" src="cleric.png"/>

<p class="body">Each of these class-specific panels contain up to two common icons displayed at the top-right of the tab: a lightning bolt image labeled "Spells", and a star image labeled "Special". Moving the mouse over these icons will display your progression towards maximum levels in those classes, with the levels you've not yet reached greyed out. This provides a convenient quick reference for the abilities you gain when advancing levels.

<p><img border="0" src="classstats.png"/>

<!-- Not enough to mention it here
<p class="body">Some tabs have an "Ex-&lt;Class Name&gt;?" checkbox on them. For these classes, if you change your alignment or commit some heinous deed that results in the loss of your powers and/or status in that class, click this checkbox to remove any powers or abilities you no longer have.
-->

<p class="body">If you delete all levels of a particular class, Hero Lab will delete the corresponding class tab, along with all the information you entered on that tab.

<p class="body">Let's look at some common features of the various class tabs:

<p><img border="0" src="classspecials.png"/>

<p class="body">Each tab starts with the class proficiencies, plus any ability score improvements gained through levelling up. You also may have to pick a Barbarian Path, or a Fighter Martial Archetype, when you achieve the appropriate level.

<p class="body">At the bottom is a list of special abilities for the class. Each ability has a large number indicating its level to the left, and a description beside it. Any special ability you don't have access to is greyed out. Mousing over the question mark icon at the right of each entry displays a longer description of the ability in that row.

<p><img border="0" src="classspells.png"/>

<p class="body">Many classes have spellcasting capabilities. On the right they display the total number of spells you know and can cast per day, and on the right is a list of the left you have memorized (for clerics, rangers, wizards, etc) or the spells you know (for bards, sorcerers and other spontanous spellcasters.

<p><img border="0" src="spellbook.png"/>

<p class="body">Some classes, like the Wizard, learn their spells from spellbooks. They can only memorize a spell once it has been added to their spellbook (by clicking on the spellbook button).

<p class="section">Companions

<p class="body">Certain classes assign companions. Once your class becomes eligible for the service of a companion, Hero Lab adds it as a separate hero.

<p><img border="0" src="companion.png"/>

<p class="body">Once added, you can click the crosshairs button (or the "Activate" button in the Dashboard) to switch to the companion to edit it and pick its type. Different races have different statistics and level requirements. You can remove the companion by pressing the delete button to the right of the companion area.

<p class="section">Skills Tab

<p class="body">The "Skills" tab lists all of your skills, showing the net skill check adjustment for each skill in large, bold text for instant recognition. A black dot beside a skill indicates proficiency in that skill; a light dot indicates non-proficiency. <!--Certain skills will be prefaced with an icon <img border="0" src="armorcheck.png"/>, which indicates that the skill is subject to Armor Check penalties. If you equip armor for your hero, any appropriate penalties will be applied to the net skill check adjustment shown. If you want to view the skill check value without the effects of the armor, simply unequip the armor.-->

<p><img border="0" src="skills.png"/>

<!--
<p class="body">To the right of the net value is an incrementer control that is used to increase/decrease the number of skill points assigned to each skill. The skill names are color-coded to indicate whether a particular skill is a class skill (purple), a cross-class skill (black), or a cross-class skill you don't have any ranks in and cannot use (grey). This enables you to allocate skill points with full knowledge of the benefit you're getting from your points. You can enter a value directly into an adjustment control by clicking over the number within it.
-->

<p class="body">Simply move the mouse over the info icon to obtain instant mouse-over help text for the skill.

<p><img border="0" src="infobutton.png"/>

<!--
<p class="body">Not all skills appear in this list by default; some skills (such as all Knowledge, Craft, Perform and Profession skills) must be added using the "Add Additional Skill" button at the bottom of the tab. This ensures that your skill listing is only populated by the skills you want to use.
-->

<!--
<p class="section">Feats Tab

<p class="body">The "Feats" tab lists the various feats that have been assigned to the character. This includes all of the feats that are automatically assigned due to the selection of classes and race. If the character has automatic feats due to class and/or race, those feats will appear in light blue text to differentiate them, and they will always be positioned at the bottom of the list. Adding a feat is as simple as clicking in the region at the bottom of the list that prompts you to do so.

<p><img border="0" src="feats.png"/>

<p class="body">The resulting form is similar to the class selection form you used above for levels, with a few important differences. Some feats will be displayed in grey, which indicates that you don't have the necessary pre-requisites for those feats and should not take them. To learn what pre-requisites are not yet satisfied, click on the feat and its description will list the missing requirements. Some feats can only be selected a single time. Those feats are removed from the available list once they have been selected.

<p><img border="0" src="choosefeat.png"/>

<p class="body">A few feats allow you to improve one specific, selectable aspect of your character. For example, adding the Weapon Focus feat lets you choose which weapon to apply the focus, while adding the Skill Focus feat allows you to choose a skill to receive the +3 bonus. These assignments are made on the edit panel, after you've added the feat. Once the feat is added, you'll see a droplist from which to select the appropriate target for the ability, and Hero Lab automatically applies the appropriate adjustments.

<p class="body">To learn more about a feat while on the "Feats" tab, move the mouse over the icon and full details appear. To delete a feat, click on the delete button. Only user-added feats can be deleted. The total number of feats remaining for selection is shown at the bottom of the list of feats.

<p class="body">If a character has special feats added via the corresponding class tab (e.g. fighters and wizards), those feats will also be shown in the list. These feats will be shown in white to indicate that they are user-added. However, they will not be deletable from this tab. They must be deleted from the class-specific tab where they were added.

<p class="body">As with other tabs, once feats are added, they also appear in the corresponding summary panel. You can move the mouse over the feat entry in the summary panel to view the help text there.
-->

<p class="section">Weapons Tab

<p class="body">The "Weapons" tab shows the details for the different weapons owned by the hero. As usual, you can mouse over the question mark icon to see the full description of the weapon.

<p class="body">If a weapon has a small "forbidden" icon beside the name, you're not proficient with it. You can still use the weapon, but at a significant attack penalty (which is included in the attack bonus shown).

<p><img border="0" src="weapons.png"/>

<p class="body">Click on the prompt to add a new weapon and the Choose Weapon form appears. By default, the size of weapons you add defaults to your own, but you can purchase different sized equipment by choosing a different size from the menu.

<p><img border="0" src="chooseweapon.png"/>

<p class="body">On the Choose Weapon form, a list of weapons is displayed, along with each weapon's damage value(s), cost, and other details. Any weapons that you can't use (typically, due to proficiency requirements) are greyed out. Clicking on a weapon shows its full details in the description window on the right. As with classes and spells, you can choose how many of a weapon to add. For example, entering "10" in the "Number to Add" region will acquire 10 Longswords in one transaction.

<p class="body">Beneath this familiar information is a region where you can pay for your weapons. When you select an item on the left, its cost is entered in the "Cost (Each)" region. The "Number to Add" is reset to one, and the "Cost (Total)" is calculated as the same as the "each" price. If you modify the quantity to purchase, the total cost automatically re-calculated. You now have to tell Hero Lab how much you're actually going to pay for the item. If you're GM uses the standard prices from the SRD, simply click on the "Set" button to let Hero Lab populate the payment region with the amount to be paid. Alternately, you can enter a custom price, if the GM decides that for some reason Longswords are cheaper or more expensive today (maybe there's a shortage). If you're not interested in having Hero Lab track your finances, just check the "Buy for Free?" checkbox and there's nothing further to worry about.

<p class="body">When you add a weapon, the coins you specify in the "Pay" blanks are deducted from your current cash unless the "Buy for Free?" checkbox is marked. If any of the coin values are set to negative values, you'll gain that much cash. This makes it easy to "get change" for your purchase. For example, you can pay for a weapon that costs 1 SP with 1 GP and -9 SP, with the 1 GP being spent and 9 SP received in change.

<p class="body">If the "Total to Pay" value at the bottom appears in white, you're paying the standard amount for that many items. If value is shown in yellow, you're paying something different from what would normally be expected. And it the value is in red, you don't have enough of the specified coins to buy the item. If you have enough total money available, you can substitute different amounts of other coins, or pay with a higher value coin and make change. Regardless of the value you elect to pay, Hero Lab will complete the transaction when you click either the "Add" or "Add & Close" button.

<p class="body">After the list of normal weapons, a list of magic weapons is shown that can also be added to the character. Magical weapons don't typically have a cost - instead, you add them when you find them in-game. Some magical weapons need to be customized once added, so you can pick which type of weapon they are.

<p><img border="0" src="customweapon.png"/>

<p class="body">Once you've bought some weapons, you have to decide which ones you want to use. You can equip up to two weapons at once, so each weapon has up to two checkboxes beside its name. There are three possible checkboxes, and clicking in them has different effects:

<ul class="bullet">
<li class="bullet">1st - Checking this box equips a weapon in your primary hand.
<li class="bullet">2nd - Checking this box equips a weapon in your secondary hand. (Remember, wielding a weapon in your secondary hand imposes considerable attack modifiers). You can check both the 1st and 2nd boxes for a single weapon to indicate that you want to use that weapon in both hands at once.
<li class="bullet">Both - If a weapon can only be used in two hands, this box will be shown. Checking it uses the weapon in both hands.
<!--
<li class="bullet">Dbl - Only shown for Double Weapons. Clicking this box equips the weapon in both hands as a Double Weapon, meaning you can use both ends to attack as if you had two separate weapons.
-->
</ul>

<p class="body">Once you equip your weapons, they appear in the table at the top. Your strength bonus is applied to their damage, and their attack bonus is calculated based on your character's statistics. If you try to equip more than one weapon in each hand, the weapons will turn red to indicate an error.

<p class="body">To sell a weapon, press the delete button . Instead of the normal delete confirmation form, a new form appears showing the weapon's value and how much you will receive for selling it. The sell price defaults to zero (i.e. just delete it), but the price can be set to 100%, 50% of 0% of the cost by clicking the appropriate button. Alternately, you can enter whatever price your GM designates as the sell cost. Once you press "OK", the weapon is deleted and the specified amount of cash is added to your total.

<p><img border="0" src="sellform.png"/>

<!--
<p class="body">Clicking in the "New Magic, Custom or Masterwork Weapon" region allows you to add magical or otherwise customized weapons. You can either add a weapon from the list, or choose the first item, "Custom / Magic Weapon".

<p><img border="0" src="customweapon.png"/>

<p class="body">When creating a custom weapon, you can choose the magical bonus for the weapon, the weapon type, the weapon material, and any special abilities for the weapon. Double Weapons have an additional option - you can choose whether the second head has the same powers as the first, or has no special abilities and has 1 worse magical bonus.

<p class="body">The total equivalent bonus and cost of the weapon are displayed at the bottom of the form. Clicking OK adds the weapon to your inventory. It appears like any other, with an "Edit" button that brings up the Custom Weapon form so you can make further changes if necessary.
-->

<p class="section">Armor Tab

<p class="body">The "Armor" tab works very much like the "Weapons" tab, and buying armor and shields works exactly like buying weapons.

<p><img border="0" src="armor.png"/>

<p class="body">To equip armor or a shield, check the single box beside the item. You can only equip a single piece of armor or shield at once. Equipping more will cause Hero Lab to report a validation error.

<p class="body">Once armor is equipped, all of the appropriate effects of that armor are applied. For example, equipping a set of Chain mail armor will remove your dexterity bonus from your AC. You can see this in action by toggling whether the armor is equipped and watching the effects in the "Basics" summary panel.

<p class="body">Like the weapons tab, the armor tab allows you to add magical and customized armor, which is displayed after the non-magical armor in the list.

<p class="section">Magic Tab

<p class="body">The "Magic" tab behaves the same way as the "Weapons" and "Armor" tabs, but for magic items. Checking the box next to an item indicates that the item has been equipped (if applicable), at which point all effects of that item are conferred. So adding the "Gauntlets of Ogre Power" item to your hero does not confer any of the bonuses. However, those bonuses are applied as soon as the item is equipped. When the Strength adjustment is applied, the Strength is shown with the additional bonus and flagged with an "*" to indicate the effect is in force.

<p class="body">Some magic items must be attuned to you to use - for those items, an "Attuned?" checkbox is displayed at the top-right. Your character can only attune to a certain number of items at once.

<p><img border="0" src="magicitems.png"/>

<p class="body">To create a scroll, add a "Spell Scroll" item from the list of magic items. You will then be shown the "Create Scroll" form, which will allow you to add a spells to the scroll.

<p><img border="0" src="createscroll.png"/>

<p class="section">Gear Tab

<p class="body">The "Gear" tab is where you'll buy and sell miscellaneous gear other than weapons, armor, and magic items. The purchasing and selling of gear works just like weapons and armor. One key difference is that, if you buy more than one of an item on the "Gear" tab, the purchased items are shown in a "stack", with the number of items in the stack displayed appropriately.

<p><img border="0" src="gear.png"/>

<p class="body">A special "Money" item is displayed on the "Gear" tab that represents your money. The purpose of this item is to track the total weight of the coins you possess, so this item is always shown at the bottom of all of your gear. To ignore the effects of coin weight (and hide this item), you can select the "No Coin Weight" rule from the Configure Hero form.

<p class="section">Personal Tab

<p class="body">The "Personal" tab provides a place to document all of the "fluff" background information for your character, providing the character with depth and personality. Fields are provided for common personal information such as age, height and weight, and a large area is available for you to enter freeform text about your Hero's personal background.

<p><img border="0" src="personal.png"/>

<p class="body">You can even attach multiple pictures of your character if you wish. The images work very much like all the other tables within Hero Lab, except that each entry in the table is an image. To assign a picture to an entry, click within the indicated region and select the image file to be used, after which it will be shown within the entry. You can add new entries by clicking in the area that prompts you to add another image.

<p class="section">Journal Tab

<p class="body">Characters are not just created - they evolve through play. After you create your character, you need a means to chronicle the exploits of your character as it goes on adventures. This is achieved via the journal mechanism within Hero Lab, and it's accessed via the correspondingly named "Journal" tab. The journal is much like a diary, with each journal entry representing an entry in that diary.

<p><img border="0" src="journalentry.png"/>

<p class="body">Each journal entry has a title and occurs on a particular date. Both a game world date and a real world date can be tracked. You can also enter extensive notes for an entry by clicking on the notes button.

<p class="body">Journal entries are also used to track the assignment of experience point awards and cash acquisitions. This provides an integrated mechanism for tracking the awards assigned by the GM, with the awarded experience points tallied and used to determine when it's time to level up.

<p class="body">To see how this works, start by adding a new journal entry. To add experience, type the experience points to add into the control beside the "Add XP" button and then click the button. The amount entered is added to the total shown for the journal entry, as well as to your Hero's overall experience point total (which can be verified within the "Basics" summary panel). Similarly, to add cash, type the cash values into the coin controls and press the "Earn" button. (NOTE! You can also enter negative amounts for losing money and experience.)

<p class="body">Each journal entry maintains its own separate record of how much experience and cash you gained, allowing you to use them as a permanent record of your adventures.

<p class="body">NOTE! If someone else in your gaming group serves as the resident "scribe" for your adventures, there is no requirement to use the journal mechanism for anything other than the acquisition of experience points and money. You can simply add a new journal entry at the end of each day of gaming that lists how much of each of those resources your hero has gained.

<p class="body">NOTE! When you delete a journal entry, the money and experience you earned from that entry is deducted from your hero.

<p class="body">At the top of the Journal tab, you'll see the the starting number of experience points and cash that you assigned when you created your hero. These values are derived from the starting values you specified on the Configure Hero form and can be changed on that form.

<p class="section">Special Tab

<p class="body">The "Special" tab provides a summary of the variou special abilities of the character that are situational in nature. If an ability provides a permanent effect, that effect is automatically added in by Hero Lab and is reflected in the adjusted value(s). However, some abilities only apply in special situations, such as the Barbarian's Danger Sense. These are the abilities that are often forgotten by players in the heat of battle and that can have a profound impact on the success of the hero. Hero Lab culls these abilities together into a single list for quick reference during the game, so you no longer have to worry about accidentally forgetting to use a special ability.

<p><img border="0" src="specials.png"/>

<p class="body">There is no way to modify anything on this tab. The special abilities listed on this tab all derive from the addition of levels, feats, skills, and equipment via other tabs.

<p class="section">In-Play Tab

<p class="body">The "In-Play" tab includes mechanisms to track health and abilities used by your hero.

<p><img border="0" src="inplay.png"/>

<p class="body">In the uppermost section of the tab, you can track the damage your hero sustains in combat. To apply damage, enter the amount in the edit control, and press the skull button; to heal damage, enter the amount to be healed and press the heal button.

<p class="body">You can see a history of damage applied by mousing over the info button on the right hand side of the damage area - this lists all damage applied to and healed from your character, so you can get an instant report of how you got to your current state. Finally, you can press the "Reset" button to remove all damage from the hero.

<p class="body">The "Tracked Resources" section lets you keep track of limited resources available to your hero. In the above screenshot, we can see that the hero has 4 uses of the Rage ability left. Clicking the small "rewind" button beside the incrementer resets the uses of a tracked resource.

<p class="body">Below the resources are the "Activated Abilities". Checking one of the boxes for these abilities will apply the corresponding effects to your character. For example, the "Rage" entry is added when you add a level of Barbarian to your hero.

<p class="body">The bottom section of the tab, under "Equipped Weapons and Armor", shows your currently equipped items. You can mouse over the info button to see a summary of the statistics for an item; to equip and de-equip items, see the Weapons and Armor tabs.

<p class="section">Adjustments Tab

<p class="body">The "Adjustments" tab tracks just about everything that occurs to your hero during the game. Conditions can be applied that reduce or change your statistics; you can also add adjustments to abilities and other facets of the hero, such as poison, spell effects, etc.

<p><img border="0" src="adjust.png"/>

<p class="body">The upper Conditions section of the tab shows a variety of common conditions that can be applied to the hero. Each can be checked and unchecked individually; when a condition is checked, it applies the appropriate modifiers to the hero.

<p class="body">The lower section allows you to apply "Adjustments" to your hero. Adjustments can be added for many things, including ability scores, hit points, encumbrance, and others. To adjust any one of these features, add the appropriate adjustment type, then use the adjustment control to increase or decrease the value as needed. As you customize the adjustment, the influences of the adjustment are re-calculated throughout the hero. If you wish, you can record the source and duration of the adjustment for easier tracking. This mechanism can be used to track both temporary and permanent effects on the hero. For temporary effects, simply delete the adjustment entry when the effects wear off.

<p class="body">NOTE! You can use Adjustments to address discrepancies between how Hero Lab tracks the 5th Edition SRD rules versus the rules of your particular game. For example, if your GM assigns all characters from a particular region a special bonus that doesn't count towards the normal limit, Hero Lab may report a validation error when you add the bonus item. Simply add an appropriate adjustment and the error goes away. But remember: Use this power wisely!

<p class="section">Spells Tab

<p class="body">The "Spells" tab will appear only when your hero has one or more levels in any spellcasting class. This tab presents a list of all your spells from all spellcasting classes, and the spell slots you have available to cast them with. Cantrips are also shown for quick reference.

<p><img border="0" src="spells.png"/>

<p class="section">Dice Roller

<p class="body">Whether you want to randomly roll up a character or obtain random numbers for use during game play, Hero Lab incorporates a flexible dice roller that you can use to roll a wide range of values. You can access the dice roller via the "Tools" menu. To use the dice roller, you must specify the number and type of die to be rolled, along with any additional modifiers. For example, you can add a value to each die, add a value to the entire roll, and even drop the N lowest or highest values rolled. You can also tell Hero Lab how many dice rolls to perform in one batch.

<p><img border="0" src="diceroller.png"/>

<p class="body">For example, let's assume you want to roll up six attribute scores. You want to roll four six-sided dice per attribute and throw out the lowest die rolled, keeping the best three. On the dice roller form, you would first enter the values "4" and "6" in the upper left corner to indicate a roll of four six-sided dice. In the "Drop Lowest" field, enter a value of "1" to drop the lowest die. In the "Number of Rolls" field, enter a "6" corresponding to the six attribute scores you want to generate. Then click the "Roll" button, and your six attribute scores are generated, complete with details on each set of values.

<!--<p class="body">One thing you cannot do with the dice roller is have Hero Lab roll the values directly in the various fields of the character. For example, you cannot have Hero Lab automatically put the six values you rolled into the attribute scores. The license under which the d20 System data files for Hero Lab were initially released specifically forbade software from automatically assigning attribute values; in order to comply with the stipulations of that license, Hero Lab can roll up values for you, but it is up to you to assign them where you want them. This behavior may change in the future.-->

<p class="section">Dashboard


<p class="body">Each dashboard entry shows important information for the hero (name, hit points and armor class). The name is displayed in yellow for the currently visible hero, blue for a companion, and white otherwise.

        <table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0>
          <tr>

            <td valign="center">
<p class="body">As well as the name and other details, you can see several buttons on each entry in the table. These buttons do several things, including:

<ul class="bullet">

<li class="bullet"><font class="strong"/>Crosshairs Button <img src="activate_hero.png"/></font> - Click this button to switch to that hero. For example, in the example shown here, Bael Domon is the active hero. You could click the crosshairs button in Tyrania Gosdark's entry to make her the current hero.

<li class="bullet"><font class="strong"/>Bag Button <img src="fetch_gear.png"/></font> - Mouse over this button to see a list of the gear the hero has, as well as their encumbrance and current cash. Click the button to fetch gear from the hero and move it to the current hero.

<li class="bullet"><font class="strong"/>Star Button <img src="dashboard_special.png"/></font> - This is a mouse-over info button. Mouse over it to see information on the hero's special abilities.

<li class="bullet"><font class="strong"/>Info Button <img src="dashboard_info.png"/></font> - This is a mouse-over info button. Mouse over it to see information on the hero's core information - attributes, saving throws and skills.

<li class="bullet"><font class="strong"/>Sword &amp; Shield Button <img src="dashboard_weapons.png"/></font> - This is a mouse-over info button. Mouse over it to see information on the hero's weapons and armour.

<li class="bullet"><font class="strong"/>Lightning Bolt Button <img src="dashboard_spells.png"/></font> - This is a mouse-over info button. Mouse over it to see information on the hero's available spells and psionic powers. (This button does not appear if the hero has no spells.)

<li class="bullet"><font class="strong"/>Conditions Button <img src="dashboard_conditions.png"/></font> - This is a mouse-over info button. Mouse over it to see information on conditions and adjustments currently affecting the hero. (This button does not appear if there are no conditions or adjustments present.)

They may also be deleted from the current portfolio using the "Delete Hero" selection on the "Portfolio" menu. When adding or deleting a hero from the current portfolio, that change is reflected in the Dashboard and Tactical Console.

<p class="section" id="tactical">Tactical Console

<p class="body">As outlined in the Hero Lab User Manual, the <a href="..\..\docs\redirect\tactical_console.htm">Tactical Console</a> is a powerful tool for managing player characters, their allies and their opponents during adventure and combat. The Hero Lab user manual provides a complete overview of the functions and workings of the Tactical Console, and we recommend you review the material presented there. Below we elaborate on the Tactical Console's specific 5th Edition SRD details.

<p class="body">When in Non-combat mode, click the <font class="strong">New Combat</font> button to enter Combat mode. When in Combat mode, click the <font class="strong">End Combat</font> button to return to Non-Combat mode. At the end of each round of combat, click the <font class="strong">Next Round</font> button, to clear the previous round and reset the initiative order to that at the start of the first round.

<p class="subsection"><u>Non-Combat Display</u></font>

<p class="body">The Tactical Console's Non-Combat mode is intended to provide the GM with all the information he needs for each character when running a roleplaying game.

<p class="body" align="left"><img src="tactical_console.png">

<p class="body">Next to the character's name you'll find his or her class and level, hit points, armor class, and speed.

<p class="body">In the central area of the console, you'll find the character's saving throws and skills. To the right of the skills are the info buttons, which are identical to, and display the same information as, the info buttons on the Dashboard (see above).


<p class="subsection"><u>Combat Display</u></font>

<p class="body">Intended to help the GM manage combat during play, the Tactical Console's Combat mode offers very specific support for the 5th Edition SRD system.

<p class="body" align="left"><img src="tactical_console_combat.png">

<p class="body">Note that in Combat mode, many of the skills and abilities formerly displayed with each character in Non-Combat mode have been replaced with combat related information, such as a list of equipped weapons.

<p class="body">Several new buttons have appeared, and initiative values have appeared below the info buttons. The characters are also now arranged in descending order of initiative.

<ul class="bullet">

<!--
<li class="bullet"><font class="strong"/>Flat-Footed</font> icon <img src="flat_footed.png"/> - At the start of a new combat, a character is considered Flat-Footed until his first action in the combat. As soon as the character takes their first action (or even delays or readies an action) the Flat-Footed icon will disappear.
-->

<li class="bullet"><font class="strong"/>Action</font> Button <img src="action_act_active_up.png"/> - When the Action button turns green for a hero, it means that character can now take his or her action. When the hero is done with all actions for the current round, push the Action button to cycle the hero to the end of the initiative list, and it becomes the next character's turn to act, in ititiative order.

<!--
<li class="bullet"><font class="strong"/>Delay</font> Button <img src="action_delay_active_up.png"/> - Click this button for the acting hero to delay his or her action. When delaying, the hero remains at the top of the list and the opportunity to act moves to the hero with the next highest initiative. When the character chooses to act, later in the round, click the greyed-out version of the Action button for that character to complete his action and cycle him to the end of the initiative list.
-->

<li class="bullet"><font class="strong"/>Ready Action</font> Button <img src="action_ready_active_up.png"/> - If the acting hero needs to ready an action, click this button. When readying an action, the hero remains at the top of the list and the opportunity to act moves to the hero with the next highest initiative. When the action is readied, click the greyed-out version of the Action button for that character to complete the action and cycle him to the end of the initiative list.
