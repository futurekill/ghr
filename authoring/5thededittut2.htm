<p class="body">In this tutorial, you'll build on what you learned in <a href="./5thededittut1.htm">the first tutorial</a> and add something a little more complex than a feat - a new race, and a subrace for an existing race.

              <p class="body">We're going to make a new race called "Fair Folk", which is very similar to the current Elf race.

              <p class="body">In the first tutorial we created a new feat by clicking the "New (Blank)" button. Here, however, we want to make something that's very similar to a race that already exists, so click the "New (Copy)" button.

              <p class="body">After clicking "New (Copy)", a form should appear asking what we want to make a copy of. We want to make a new race that's pretty similar to the Elf, so find "Elf" in the list, click on it and press OK. Hero Lab will make a copy of the Elf race and present it to you for editing.

<p class="section">Change the name and unique id

<p class="body"><img class="border" src="./tut2_nameid.png">

<p class="body">The first thing we need to do is change the name, so we can distinguish our new race from the standard "Elf". Click in the "Name" edit control and change the name to <font class="strong">"Fair Folk"</font>.

<p class="body">Just like our Two Hand Smash feat from the first tutorial, we need to assign a unique id to our new race. "r?" isn't a valid unique id, so change it to something like <font class="strong">"rJSFairFol"</font> - "r" because this is a race, JS for our user identifier, and "FairFol" because that relates to the race name well.

<p class="section">How are Fair Folk different?

              <p class="body">Take a look at the table in the bottom-center of the form. This table displays a list showing everything that you can change about the race. It starts with commonly-used things like Strength and Dexterity modifiers, and continues down through speed, tool/skill proficiencies, number of bonus languages, and more. There's more than one page of information - you can use the scroll bar to scroll down and see other things that can be edited.

              <p class="body">If you're curious about any of the entries, mouse over the <img src="./tabs_info.png"> icon on their right to see what they do. Each entry has a short description of its purpose.

              <p class="body">Right at the top of the list are the 6 ability score modifiers the race has. We want to make Fair Folk much stronger than regular elves, so let's say that they get a +2 Strength bonus as well as the normal Elf bonus to Dexterity. In the edit control to the right of "Strength Modifier", enter the number <font class="strong">"2"</font>.

            <td valign="center">
              <p class="body">Let's make another change to our race. Instead of the regular Elf automatic languages, Fair Folk should get different ones - instead of Elvish, they can speak Sylvan and Druidic. Scroll down the list on the Races tab until you see "Automatic Languages", and hit the Edit button.

              <p class="body">Scroll down the list until you see the current Elvish language, then deselect it. Select Sylvan and Druidic instead, then click OK and save the record. Hit the "Test Now!" button to integrate the changes you just made back into Hero Lab.

              <p class="body">This time, Hero Lab asks you if you're sure you want to continue. This happens because you have the "Fair Folk" race currently selected, and to integrate the changes, Hero Lab needs to delete the race and then add it back to the hero. Sometimes, doing this causes loss of data, so if you want to make sure the current hero is preserved, you should save it now.

              <p class="body">Once you've saved the hero (if necessary), click "Yes" to complete the integration of the new data. You can see the effects of your changes by going to the Race tab and examining the list of languages in the Racial Languages table - the Common, Druidic, and Sylvan languages are now present. To add Elvish, you must spend a slot!

<p class="section">Adding a Subrace
<p class="body">What if your race is not so different from an existing race that it needs to be its own race? Variations on existing races are called subraces, and can add extra abilities to the parent race, change its name, and more. For the purposes of this demonstration, let's add a subrace of elves which is specialized to living in the woods. We will call them... Forest Elves.

<p class="body">Subraces have their own tab under the "Race" group, so switch to the "Subrace" tab. There already exist some elven subraces, so we can start from there. Hit "New (Copy)" and choose the "High Elf" subrace as our starting point, then replace the Name, Unique ID, and Description with appropriate text for our new "Forest Elf" subrace. For the purposes of this tutorial, we'll assume the unique ID is "srJSForElf".

<p class="body"><img class="border" src="./tut2_newsubrace.png">

<p class="body">Notice that the first two items in the lower center area already have selections. "Subrace of" associates this subrace with one or more specific races, such that only the selected races can choose this subrace. Clicking the button displays a list of each and every race created for Hero Lab, which you can scroll through to see what is checked. You should see that this subrace is already associated with the "Elf" race, which we want.

<p class="body">"Subrace Modifies Race Name?" should be set to Replace. This controls whether the subrace's name is used in place of the race's name, or as a suppliment/modification to the same. Both of those things are probably fine as they stand.

<p class="body">However, unlike the Fair Folk, our subrace isn't intended to be strictly more powerful than other similar choices, so we will need to remove some advantages even as we add others. Scroll down the list of options for the race until you find the ability score bonuses and penalties. Let's say that Forest elves are wise, but not "book smart", and swap out their +1 Intelligence modifier for a +1 Wisdom modifier. Save and integrate the subrace.

<p class="body"><img class="border" src="./tut2_subracebonus.png">

<p class="section">Adding a new Racial Special and Linking it to the Subrace

<p class="body">Now let's give our subrace a unique ability that the base race doesn't get, something which speaks to the adaptation of the Forest Elf to his native biome. By now you should be well versed in creating simple, text only abilities. Go to the Racial Specials tab and create a new ability with a name of "Leafy Camouflage", the unique ID of "raJSLeafCa", and a description of "Due to mottled skin tones and irregular clothing cuts, Forest elves have an almost preternatural skill at hiding within their native forests. When making Stealth checks within the forest, they have advantage." Save and integrate the racial special using the "Test Now!" button.

<p class="body">Now, how do we link the special we just made to the Forest Elf subrace? Return to the Forest Elf subrace, then scroll down the central column until you see a button labelled "Racial Special Abilities". As when you were altering the Automatic Languages of the Fair Folk, clicking this button opens a new window, and then clicking "add another bootstrap" opens a list of options and checkboxes beside them. Since we know the name of what we want to add here, you can use the field to the right of the blue hourglass to filter this list down to exactly what we want. Type the name into that field, and check the box to the left of Leafy Camouflage (if you do not see the ability listed, you may have forgotten to integrate it with "Test now!"). Save and integrate the subrace.

<p class="body">Finally, as always, test your work by returning to the hero and adding the subrace as a pick. Do you see the expected increase to Wisdom and the new Leafy Camouflage ability? Congratulations!

<p class="section">Terminology Time!

<p class="body">As in tutorial 1, we will now put words to some of the things we did above.

<p id="fields" class="body"><font class="strong">Field</font> - One half of the building blocks of a Thing, the most common kind of fields are value fields (which store a number) and text fields (which store a string of text). When you were typing 2 into the "Strength Modifier" line of the editor, you were setting the rSTR value field of the race. You can see the contents of all fields by clicking on the blue "Fields" button in the upper right of the editor.

<p id="tags" class="body"><font class="strong">Tag</font> - Tags define what kind of Thing this is, and can trigger certain behaviours. You can think of them like post-it notes, in that they can be put on (assigned) or taken off (deleted). Each tag is composed of two parts, the Tag Group (what kind of tag it is), and the Tag ID (the name of the specific tag in that group). When you copied the High Elf subrace and saw that it was already associated with the Elf race, that was accomplished by applying the "SubRace.rElf" tag. You can see which tags have been applied to this Thing by clicking on the blue "Tags" button in the upper right of the editor.

<p id="bootstraps" class="body"><font class="strong">Bootstrap</font> - This is a link between two Things, such that when the Bootstrapping Thing is added as a Pick, the Bootstrapped Thing is also added as a Pick. It is unidirectional; adding the former always adds the latter, but adding the latter does not add the former. In the tutorial above, the Leafy Camouflage ability was bootstrapped to the Forest Elf subrace. Like Fields and Tags, Bootstraps have their own blue button in the upper right of the editor.
